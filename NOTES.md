    - `react.production.js`:
        - Its the state of application used by the client which will have the minified and builded version, which is more faster than developement

## What is async and defer ?

    - `Async` - The async attribute is a `boolean attribute`. The script is downloaded in `parallel(in the background)` to parsing the page, and `executed as soon` as it is available (do not block HTML DOM construction during downloading process) and donâ€™t wait for anything.

    ```sh
    <script src="..." async></script>
    ```

    `Defer` - The defer attribute is a `boolean attribute`. The script is downloaded in `parallel(in the background)` to parsing the page, and `executed after the page` has finished parsing(when browser finished DOM construction). The `defer attribute` tells the browser `not to wait for the script`. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM.

    ```sh
    <script src="..." defer></script>
    ```
